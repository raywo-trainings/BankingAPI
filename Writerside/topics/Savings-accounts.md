# Savings accounts

A savings account is a fundamental banking product that allows clients to 
deposit and store money while earning interest. 

These accounts are designed for long-term savings goals and provide a secure
way to accumulate funds over time.

Each savings account is associated with a client and maintains a record of all 
financial transactions through entries. 

The account features include:

- Interest earnings on deposited funds
- Regular deposit and withdrawal capabilities
- Transaction history tracking
- Balance maintenance requirements
