# Entries

An entry represents a financial transaction record in the banking system. Each
entry documents a movement of funds, including deposits, withdrawals,
transfers, and other banking operations. Entries are essential for maintaining
accurate account balances, transaction history, and ensuring proper financial
record-keeping.
